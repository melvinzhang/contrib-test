I'm from NUS SoC and am contributing to Google Guava.

I also have a couple of projects that you can contribute to.
- [scf4j](https://github.com/leeyikjiun/scf4j) A Java collections facade, makes it easy to switch between Java Collections, Trove, and etc.
- [aurora](https://github.com/leeyikjiun/aurora) Collections of high performance algorithms & data structure, exploring how fast they could be.

Visit [me](https://github.com/leeyikjiun) if you like optimization and performance as well.
